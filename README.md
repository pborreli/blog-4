# You Learn Something New Everyday

[My blog](https://rylev.github.io) - mostly about programming and computer science stuff.

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) installed, and then run:

```bash
$ hugo server -D
```

## Deploying

The process is currently manual:

1.) Clone the blog's build [repository](https://github.com/rylev.github.io).
2.) Using the `hugo` command, build the site into the cloned repo's directory.
3.) Commit those changes to master.
4.) The site will automatically update with the changes to master
