<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I'm a product of the late '80s and early '90s. After studying Marketing and Spanish at the University of Florida, I deceided to move across the pond to Deutschland where I discovered the joys of programming. Now I work at <a href="http://6wunderkinder.com">6Wunderkinder</a> in Berlin. Besides the obvious (long walks on the beach, sunsets, etc.) I like to code, cook, and travel.</p>
