Being productive is more popular than ever. Everyone wants to get more and more done in
less and less time. And no wonder. Getting things done feels really good.

Yet, "getting things done" is not always the best way to spend our time.
[Yakshaving](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yak%20shaving),
done in the right way, can also be a good way to spend time.

Here are some reaons why I find disciplined yak shaving to be a good thing and
some things I've learned along the way about how to do it well.

### Edifying Yak Shaving

When I was learning how to program, I often felt overwhelmed by the amount of
information that was available about programming and computer science. Instead
of picking one area to stick to and focus on (e.g. rails development), I started down a
path of yak shaving.

I learned a little about Rails, which led me to learn more about Ruby, which then led
me to look into C (on which Ruby is built). Before I knew it, I was looking a
bit into programming language interpreters.

Of course, one doesn't need to know anything about the Ruby interpreter to be
an expert Rails developer. And many would even argue that learning such things
only servers as a distraction. However, when I then went back to Rails I found things easier
to understand. I was not only able to achieve this because my time in Ruby land
had taught me what a "@" really means, but also because the edges around what
I was learning became clearer.

Through my deliberate yak shaving distraction, the distracting "great unkown"
at the boundaries of what I learned faded away.

While the uneasy feeling that comes with "just not knowing" would come back,
the peace that deliberate yak shaving had afforded me allowed me to learn
more effectively.

### Self Improvement Yak Shaving

We tend to stick to what we know. Now that I'm beyond being a beginner, I've
noticed that if I wanted to, I could get by just fine on what I already know.
However, anyone who enjoys what they do (as I do programming) knows that this
just won't cut it.

Reading books and listening to podcasts are some ways to further yourself, but
often times the best way to learn new things is to go on a good ol' fashion yak
shave. Put yourself in the middle of an area where you "shouldn't be" and force
yourself to learn your way out.

### Careful Yak Shaving

Yak shaving can get dangerous. Obviously, it's important to know when not to
start yak shaving. Don't, for example, go on a great yak shave while the
servers you're in charge of a work are on fire.

However, it's equally, if not more, important to know when to stop yak shaving.
In order to reap the benefits of an edifying yak shaving you need to return to
the original task at hand. Stay too far away and you may never get back.

Also, knowing the limits of where you think the yak shaving should take you
is very important. You don't want yak shaving to become an extremely tedious or
frustrating activiy. If you feel overly frustrated, you've gone too far, and
you'll kill the motivating experience that yak shaving can be.

So I suggest giving a yak shave a go. See how long you stick to each part of
the yak shave. Do you spend too much time on one thing so that you've forgetten
how and why you got there? Do you spend too little time and fail to appreciate
what you can learn at each step?

Happy Yak Shaving!
